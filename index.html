            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>I coach people through moments of decision - whether itâ€™s applying to a top university, pursuing a prestigious scholarship, or reimagining their career path.</p>
            <p>I help students, professionals, and changemakers clarify their direction, prepare strong applications, and take the next bold step - whether that means new skills, a mindset shift, or simply the courage to act.</p>
            <p>I also advise organizations and programs on education, employability, and leadership - bringing experience in coaching, interculturality, and public speaking to every space I work in.</p>

            <h2>Intercultural Experience</h2>
            <p>I've lived and worked in Argentina, Haiti, France, the UK, and more - adapting to each culture and learning from every community.</p>
            <p>I speak Spanish, English, French, Portuguese, and some German, and I use this multilingual, multicultural perspective in everything I do.</p>
            <p>My mission is to foster meaningful cooperation across borders, values, and lived experiences.</p>
